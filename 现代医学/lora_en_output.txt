There is a build-up of secretions in the bronchi. In order to clear the secretions, the bronchi contract, which causes cough. I hope this information helps. Please feel free to ask me for any further clarifications. Regards.

Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. Yes, HEPA filters are used in many places to filter out dust particles, and they are quite efficient in doing so. HEPA stands for high efficiency particulate air. These filters can trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger in diameter. As the diameter of the coronavirus is about 120 nanometers (0.12 microns) and the virus is usually spread through droplets that are 5 microns in diameter, HEPA filters are quite efficient in capturing the virus. However, the virus can be transmitted through airborne transmission as well, so HEPA filters may not be able to filter out all the virus particles. In addition, it is also important to clean your car and office regularly with disinfectants to prevent the spread of the virus. I hope this information helps you.

Thank you for sharing your question with us. This is a very common question. HIV is a virus which has a high mutation rate. This means that the virus changes its surface proteins constantly. These changes are very important to avoid detection by our immune system. HIV antibodies are produced by the immune system to fight against the virus. This is why the detection of HIV antibodies is delayed. However, the HIV RNA is not affected by the immune system. This is why HIV RNA appears in the blood earlier than the HIV antibodies. I hope this helps.

Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, and the most common causes of pneumonia are bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The symptoms of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough, phlegm, and difficulty breathing. Sore eyes and ears with coughing and wheezing are not the symptoms of pneumonia. Pneumonia is not a cause of sore eyes and ears. Sore eyes and ears with coughing and wheezing can be a symptom of viral infection. I hope this answers your question. Please let us know if you need any more information.
If you are suffering from pneumonia, I would like to recommend that you should get in touch with your treating doctor and start taking the right antibiotics for your condition. If you are not sure which antibiotic to take, please get a culture of the sputum and send it to the lab for testing. This will help you to know which antibiotic would be most effective. Once you start taking the antibiotics, you should be able to breathe normally again. I hope you find this information helpful.
If you have been in contact with a person who is suspected to be infected with the coronavirus, you are at a high risk of getting infected. You should go for a test for the virus. The test is called PCR test and it is done by taking a swab from your nose and throat and sending it to the lab for testing. It is a quick test and takes only a few hours to get the results. If the results come negative, you do not need to worry about the virus. If they come positive, you should immediately isolate yourself and contact your local health authority. Hope this helps.
Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. I have reviewed your query. If you have symptoms of cough, cold, breathlessness, fever, then you need to get tested for coronavirus. It is a very important test, so you should get it done. If you have no symptoms, then you do not need to get tested. You should take precautions and avoid contact with others. Hope this is helpful to you. Feel free to ask any further questions. Regards
First of all, you need to understand the symptoms of coronavirus. The symptoms of coronavirus are fever, cough, difficulty in breathing. It can cause serious disease in some people, but most people infected with the virus have only mild illness. It is important to take precautions to avoid getting sick. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands. If you are in a public place, avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you have any symptoms of coronavirus, you need to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. If you are in a place where there is an outbreak of coronavirus, you need to stay away from the area. If you are worried about getting coronavirus, you need to talk to your doctor.

Pneumonia is a lung infection that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other organisms. When the infection doesn't clear up quickly or doesn't respond to treatment, it's considered chronic or persistent pneumonia. Pneumonia can be persistent in patients with chronic lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Infections can become persistent in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) because the infection can settle into the airways. Persistent pneumonia may also occur in people who have chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart failure, or cancer. People with weak immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, also may develop persistent pneumonia. Persistent pneumonia may also occur in people who have had lung surgery, especially if they've had surgery involving the removal of part of the lung. Persistent pneumonia may also occur in people who have had a lung transplant. People who have had a lung transplant are at risk for a condition called chronic graft rejection, which can cause pneumonia that doesn't respond to treatment. Persistent pneumonia may also occur in people who have had a bone marrow transplant. People who have had a bone marrow transplant are at risk for a condition called graft-versus-host disease, which can cause
Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs. It is usually caused by infection, but can also be caused by injury to the lungs. Pneumonia can affect one lung or both lungs. It can affect one part of the lung or all of it. It is a very common disease, and it can affect people of all ages. Pneumonia is a very serious condition and can be life-threatening, particularly for the elderly and the very young. Pneumonia can be caused by many different types of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi. The most common organisms responsible for pneumonia are bacteria, especially streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most common symptoms of pneumonia include: - Cough - Fever and chills - Shortness of breath - Sore throat - Chest pain - Fatigue - Nausea and vomiting - Diarrhea - Headache - Confusion - Sweating and shivering - Rapid breathing and rapid heart rate - Muscle aches and pains - Loss of appetite - Loss of weight The symptoms of pneumonia may vary depending on the type of pneumonia, the age of the patient
Yes, they are live organisms. They are able to reproduce, and they are able to mutate. This is why they are able to cause disease. They are not considered to be alive by some people, but they do meet the definition of a living organism.
1. It is very unlikely that you have corona virus, and you should not be scared. 2. The symptoms you have are common with most upper respiratory tract infections. 3. You should take an antibiotic for 5 days (e.g. Augmenting 625 mg twice a day for 5 days) and take paracetamol 500 mg three times a day for 5 days. 4.

I am sorry, but there is no evidence that a cool mist vaporizer will help in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. There are many myths and rumors that are floating around on social media, but the best way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is to wash your hands regularly, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with your hands, and avoid close contact with sick people. Hope this helps.
I would advise you to get your chest X-ray done to rule out pneumonia. Also, you need to get your CBC done to rule out infection. Please also take some painkiller and antipyretic like paracetamol for fever. Please do not take any NSAID. If the chest x-ray and CBC are normal, you need to see a pulmonologist for further management. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further question I will be happy to help.

If you have been in close contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus, then you should be tested for the infection. The test is done by taking a sample from the throat and nose. The test is not very specific in the early phase of infection, and you may have to repeat the test after 7-10 days if the first test comes out negative. The test can be done at a public hospital or a private lab, but you will have to consult a doctor and get a prescription for the test.
I suggest you to get her tested for the same as there are no specific symptoms of fever and cough, and it can be due to many reasons. She can be tested for the same and the results can help us to know the cause of her symptoms and can guide us in the treatment. Also, you can give her Paracetamol 150 mg thrice daily for 3 days to control her fever. Take care.
It seems that you are suffering from common cold. You need to take paracetamol for body aches and fever. You need to take decongestant for blocked nose. You can take cough suppressants. You need to take plenty of fluids. You need to take plenty of rest. You need to take steam inhalation. You can also consult your doctor for some antibiotic if the condition is not improved.
First, you need to get your blood tests done and chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the type of pneumonia (viral, bacterial, or fungal), treatment will vary. You may need to take antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia. For viral pneumonia, you may need to take antivirals. For fungal pneumonia, you may need to take antifungals. In addition, you may also need to take some over-the-counter medications to relieve your symptoms. You may need to take acetaminophen to reduce your fever. You may need to take ibuprofen to reduce your body aches. You may need to take cough suppressants to reduce your cough. You may need to take decongestants to reduce your congestion. You may need to take antihistamines to reduce your runny nose and sneezing. You may need to take expectorants to help you cough up mucus. You may need to take bronchodilators to help you breathe easier. You may need to take steroids to reduce your inflammation. You may need to take anticholinergics to reduce your cough. You may need to take mucolytics to help you cough up mucus. You may need to take antiemetics to reduce your nausea
Yes, it can be different. It depends on the severity of the illness. In most cases, the cough is non-productive (i.e. no sputum) and may be dry. It is sometimes associated with wheezing and shortness of breath. It is not usually associated with a runny nose, as it is not a viral infection. If the cough is productive, then it is likely to be a bacterial infection, and a sputum culture is needed. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further question I will be happy to help.
There are two ways to test for coronavirus disease. The first one is the nucleic acid test. It is done by taking a sample from the patient's upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swab) or lower respiratory tract (tracheal lavage) and then sending it for a test to detect the presence of the virus. The second one is the serology test. It is done by taking a sample of the patient's blood and then sending it for a test to detect the presence of antibodies. The test may be positive even after the patient has recovered from the disease. I hope I helped you.
Hello, thanks for your query. I have read your query. I would like to tell you that pneumonia can be caused by various organisms, and it can be associated with symptoms or can be asymptomatic. In asymptomatic pneumonia, there is no cough, fever, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, weight loss etc. In your case, I would advise you to get a chest X-ray done. If there is no abnormal finding on chest X-ray then it is a case of asymptomatic pneumonia. If there is an abnormal finding on chest X-ray then you can get sputum culture and sensitivity test done. I would advise you to get a chest X-ray and sputum culture and sensitivity test done. You can also get a CT scan of the chest done. I would advise you to get a consultation from pulmonologist. I hope this helps.
If you have a persistent cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath, you need to see a doctor immediately. You need a chest x-ray and sputum culture to see what the infection is. You need to take the appropriate antibiotics. If you are a smoker, you should quit. You should also get a tuberculosis test and a blood test for HIV. If you have a history of cancer, you should get a CT scan of your chest to look for a tumor. You need to get a PFT done to see what kind of lung disease you have. You should also get a blood test to see if you have diabetes. You need to get a blood test to see if you have anemia. You should also get a blood test to see if you have anemia.

The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days (mean of 5 days) after exposure to the virus. This means that symptoms may appear anywhere from 1 to 14 days after exposure. Transmission can occur during the incubation period, and this is why it is so important to practice social distancing and wear face masks. Transmission may also occur even after symptoms have appeared, and this is why it is so important to isolate yourself for 14 days if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. If you have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and are asymptomatic, you can still transmit the virus to others. This is why it is so important to wear face masks and practice social distancing.
Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query, and I would like to inform you that pneumonia is a serious infection and needs to be treated with antibiotics.

I hope this will help you. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards
I don't think so. First of all, the lack of beds is a very rare situation. It is possible in a pandemic but even then, doctors will try to save the patient if they have a chance to survive. The second point is that diabetes is not a risk factor for death if the patient is well controlled and has no other comorbidities.

Unfortunately, the answer is no. The coronavirus can survive on surfaces for some time. The risk is that the person preparing the food could touch the surface of the food, utensils, and plates, and then touch their face (nose, mouth, eyes). If they are sick with coronavirus, they can transfer the virus onto the food and onto their own face, and then pass it to you when you touch the food. If they are not sick, but are carrying the virus, they can transfer it onto the food and onto their own face, and then pass it to you when you touch the food. The virus can also be transmitted by sneezing or coughing. So, the safest option is to not eat food prepared by someone who is sick or who has been exposed to someone who is sick. Hope this helps.

Thank you for your question. First, it is important to understand that there are two ways that a person can get infected with the virus. The first is by inhaling the virus (airborne transmission) and the second is by touching the virus with your hands and then touching your eyes or nose with the same hands (contact transmission). So, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, it is important to take certain precautions such as wearing a mask, washing your hands frequently, and avoiding touching your eyes or nose.
I would suggest you to get your blood tested for hemoglobin, vitamin D and calcium levels. If you are on any medications for pneumonia, please mention the same.

Dear patient, thanks for your question. The chest pain in a patient with history of right para cardiac pneumonia could be due to pleurisy. It is an inflammation of the pleura (membranes that line the lungs and chest wall) due to infection. The pleura is made up of two layers, and they both have nerves which are sensitive to pain. So if the pleura is inflamed, the nerves become sensitive to pain. Pleurisy may be caused by infection or inflammation. In your case, the pain is due to infection. Other causes include inflammation of the lungs (pneumonia), pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, lung cancer, and autoimmune diseases. I suggest you take a course of antibiotics and analgesics. You may also take a decongestant. If the pain persists, please consult a physician. I hope this helps.
Thank you for posting your question to Chat Doctor. It is difficult to know whether you have a cold or the flu without more information. I recommend you see your doctor for a physical exam. If you are symptomatic, then you should get a flu test at the very least. There are also some at home tests for the flu, but I would recommend you to get tested by your doctor. If you are asymptomatic, then I recommend you to wait until you are symptomatic and then get tested. If you have any further questions, please contact Chat Doctor. Feel free to contact us again, or post a new question.

Thank you for asking in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic medication used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is an immunosuppressive medication, which means that it suppresses the immune system. This is the main mechanism of action of the medication. It suppresses the immune system and thereby helps in reducing the inflammation, which is the main feature of rheumatoid arthritis. As you rightly said, methotrexate is immunosuppressive, and it can weaken the immune system. This makes the person vulnerable to various infections including viral infections such as the one caused by the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). However, stopping the medication would lead to the recurrence of the disease. The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can be very severe and can cause joint destruction. This is why it is advisable to continue the medication. However, if you are worried about the infection, you can get yourself tested for the antibodies against the novel coronavirus. If the antibody titers are high, you can stop the medication. However, if the titers are low, you should continue the medication. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks and regards.

Yes, hand sanitizers are very effective at killing germs and other microbes that cause disease. When you use hand sanitizer, it destroys the proteins and outer covering of these germs, which makes them inactive and unable to cause disease. If you use enough hand sanitizer, you will kill all the germs on your hands. However, it is important to remember that hand sanitizers are not effective against all germs. They are not effective against norovirus, which causes stomach flu. So, it is important to wash your hands with soap and water if you think you have been exposed to norovirus.

There are many lung diseases that can cause these symptoms. One of the most common is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Another is lung cancer.

If you have cavities or gum infection, it may cause bad breath. You may require scaling and root planning. You can also get your tongue cleaned. Hope it helps.
Dear friend. Thank you for your question. The best advice I can give you is to take the test. It's not that you have been in close contact with the patient, you have been in close contact with someone who has been in close contact with a patient. So, you have a much smaller chance of being infected. However, if the patient is in the early stages of infection, the test might not detect the virus. The best thing to do is to take the test and be on the safe side.

If you are not using ciprofloxacin, then I would recommend you to get yourself checked by a doctor to rule out other causes of swollen legs. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

In other words, if you are on antibiotics for 3-4 days, you are no longer contagious. The contagiousness is more for pneumococcal pneumonia than for other types of pneumonia. If you are not sure whether you have pneumococcal pneumonia, please let me know and I will be able to guide you better. I hope you found the answer helpful. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

1. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, which can be caused by a variety of organisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. 2. In pneumonia, the lung tissue is inflamed and the air sacs or alveoli are filled with fluid and pus. 3. The infection is fought by the body with the help of the immune system, and the pus is formed as a result of this process. 4. Coughing up of clear phlegm is a normal process in pneumonia. 5. If the phlegm is green or yellow, it indicates a bacterial infection. 6. If the phlegm is rust-colored, it indicates a streptococcal infection. 7. If the phlegm is blood stained, it indicates a fungal infection. 8.

Hello, Thank you for your question. You have a history of nasal allergy, but it is not clear what is the duration of fever and how long is the fever associated with symptoms of nasal allergy. The fever is associated with symptoms of nasal allergy. Then it is likely to be due to allergic rhinitis. If fever is not associated with symptoms of nasal allergy, then it could be due to viral illness. Fever due to viral illness can persist for few days. If fever is associated with nasal allergy, then it is likely to be due to allergic rhinitis. I would suggest you to consult a general physician for further evaluation and management. Hope this helps you.

Asthma and pneumonia are two different diseases. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs while asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Asthma can be triggered by a viral infection. The risk of developing pneumonia is increased in asthmatics. However, asthma cannot be diagnosed from a pneumonia. It needs to be diagnosed separately. A chest X-ray, spirometry, and pulmonary function tests are needed for the diagnosis of asthma. So, if you are having asthma, you will be diagnosed with it separately and if you are not having asthma, it will be ruled out. So, do not worry. Just get a proper treatment for your pneumonia.
The current evidence suggests that the main mode of transmission of the virus is through respiratory droplets, such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through semen or vaginal secretions. However, as a precaution, the World Health Organization recommends that people use condoms during sex. This is to prevent the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases. It is not known whether the virus can be transmitted through other bodily fluids such as saliva, blood or urine. It is important to remember that the virus is still being studied, and more information will be made available as it becomes available.

The risk of dying from the coronavirus infection is not increased in patients with Type 1 diabetes. However, patients with Type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of developing severe disease and requiring hospitalization, compared to those without diabetes. This is because diabetes can increase the risk of developing complications such as pneumonia and sepsis, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, it is important for patients with Type 1 diabetes to take all necessary precautions to avoid infection with the coronavirus, such as washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and getting vaccinated if available. If you do become infected with the coronavirus, it is important to monitor your symptoms closely and seek medical attention if you develop any signs of severe illness. I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you for using Chat Doctor. Take care.

The only way to know for sure if you have coronavirus is to get tested. Testing can be done in two ways: 1. PCR testing - which is a test to detect the virus. 2. Serology testing - which is a test to detect antibodies to the virus. PCR testing is done early in the disease course, and serology testing is done after 10-14 days from the onset of symptoms. If you are symptomatic, it is best to consult your local doctor, and they will refer you to a facility where you can get tested. If you are asymptomatic, you can get yourself tested through the local health authorities.

In that case, you should take some anti-anxiety medication like clonazepam. But if you are middle aged or older, then you should consult a physician for further evaluation. I hope it helps.
Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. First of all, I would like to inform you that there is no evidence till now of sexual transmission of COVID-19. The virus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, so it is not a sexually transmitted disease. But as the virus is still not studied in detail, it is always better to be on the safer side and avoid any form of sexual activity with a person who is infected or suspected to be infected. Hope I answered your query.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is known to survive for hours or days on surfaces, including plastic and stainless steel. However, refrigeration is not known to kill the virus. So, the virus can survive in the fridge. But the risk of transmission by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your face is low. So, the risk of transmission is low, but you should still take precautions to prevent transmission. For example, you should wear gloves when handling the infected product. You should also wash your hands frequently with soap and water. I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.

I would like to know the exact diagnosis of your pneumonia. As pneumonia can be caused by many organisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi, mycobacteria and parasites. The type of organisms causing pneumonia and the severity of the infection will determine the course of the antibiotic treatment. Some antibiotics may not be the most effective for the type of organism causing your infection. In addition, if you are not responding to the antibiotics, it may be because you are not taking the full course of treatment. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics even if you feel better. The full course is usually 10 to 14 days. I hope this helps. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you for using Chat Doctor.

Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.
1. There are a lot of rumors and fake news regarding the use of sanitizers and its side effects.2. Sanitizers with 60% alcohol or more are good enough to kill the virus.3. However, there is no evidence that the virus is killed by the use of hand sanitizers.4. I suggest you to use the hand sanitizer with 70% alcohol.5. Also, you should wash your hands with soap and water frequently.6. The virus is very small and can only be killed by using soap and water.7. So, the best way to kill the virus is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water.8. Do not panic, as the virus is not that harmful.9.

Thanks for the question. I understand your concern. The answer is short and simple, that is, No. The mode of transmission is by respiratory route (air borne) and by contact with the secretions (saliva, sputum, feces, urine etc.) of the infected person. There is no evidence of sexual transmission of any coronavirus. However, there is no harm in taking precautions as we do for other sexually transmitted diseases. Hope it helps. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to write to us. Wish you good health.
The main treatment for pneumonia is antibiotics. In many cases, your doctor may prescribe a combination of two antibiotics to treat the infection. If you are already on levofloxacin, you may have to take a second antibiotic to treat the infection. The most common second antibiotic is a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin. The combination of levofloxacin and amoxicillin is effective against most types of pneumonia. However, your doctor may prescribe a different combination of antibiotics if the infection is caused by a particular type of bacteria. For example, if you are being treated for a lung infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), your doctor may prescribe levofloxacin along with a glycopeptide such as vancomycin. If you are being treated for a lung infection caused by a fungus, your doctor may prescribe levofloxacin along with a second antibiotic such as azithromycin. If you are being treated for a lung infection caused by a virus, your doctor may prescribe levofloxacin along with a second antibiotic such as azithromycin. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
I think you should contact the local health authority or health center. You can also visit the nearest hospital or health center to get a referral. Please don't forget to wear a mask and sanitize your hands before you visit. Hope this helps.

The answer to your question is no, there is no direct link between high blood sugar and coronavirus. However, high blood sugar is a risk factor for a number of other diseases including heart disease and kidney disease. These are both risk factors for a severe illness or death from coronavirus. So, it is very important to keep your blood sugar under control.
Yes, pneumonia can cause light-headedness, blurred vision and shortness of breath. In pneumonia the infection is in the lung and the oxygen supply to the body is reduced. In pneumonia the lung tissue is filled with infection and the oxygen cannot diffuse into the blood as the lung tissue is not normal. So the oxygen saturation decreases. The decreased oxygen saturation can cause light-headedness, blurred vision and shortness of breath.
Fever in a child is not a disease but a symptom of an infection. The main cause of fever in a child is a viral infection. The viral infections are self limiting and usually resolve in 3-5 days. The fever should be treated with paracetamol and if the child is not able to take it orally, it can be given as a suppository. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine which can be given for fever. It is safe to use in children. There is no evidence that it causes any harm to the child. However, it is better to give paracetamol as it has been used for a long time in children and its safety profile is better than ibuprofen. Hope I have answered your query. If you have further queries, I would be happy to answer them. Regards

In summary, the coronavirus is a family of viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 is the one that causes the disease known as COVID-19. I hope this helps.

The symptoms of a sore throat and running stomach are not suggestive of a coronavirus infection. It is possible that you have a viral infection, which could have been contracted by the person you traveled with or from the environment. You should take plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and antispasmodics for your stomach. If you have a fever, then you can take Paracetamol for that. You can also take a decongestant to clear up your throat. I hope you find this helpful.
The only way to be sure if you are suffering from a respiratory tract infection caused by the novel coronavirus is to get tested for it. If you have symptoms of a respiratory tract infection (such as fever, cough, shortness of breath), you can consult a physician who will decide if you should be tested for the virus. If you have not been in contact with a confirmed case, and you are not experiencing any symptoms, there is no need to be tested.
The treatment for pneumonia depends upon the cause of pneumonia, the severity of the disease and the age and general health of the patient. Pneumonia may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or other organisms. Pneumonia caused by bacteria is treated with antibiotics, whereas pneumonia caused by virus is treated with rest and analgesics. Pneumonia caused by fungi requires antifungal agents. The choice of treatment depends on the causative agent. So, I advise you to consult your doctor for further evaluation and management.
It's very hard to tell if you have common cold or a cold from a virus. The best way to know is to take the test. If you have symptoms of respiratory illness, like a cough or shortness of breath, you should definitely take the test. If you don't have any respiratory symptoms, and you're just feeling slightly under the weather, I wouldn't take the test. You can try taking over the counter medications like Tylenol, Advil, or cough syrup to see if you feel better. If you don't feel better, you should take the test. I hope this helps, please let me know if you have any more questions.
I would recommend a throat swab and chest x-ray to determine the status of your throat infection and the presence of pneumonia. I would also recommend that you take a course of antibiotics. You should also get tested for the coronavirus and take precautions to prevent the spread of the disease to others. If the test comes back positive, you should isolate yourself at home. If the test comes back negative, you should still be careful and avoid contact with others. Hope this helps.
1. Mild asthma is a controlled disease. If you are taking your medications regularly and are doing well, then you are at low risk of developing severe illness if you were to get infected with the coronavirus. 2.

Thank you for asking I understand your concern. According to CDC guidelines, a person who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 is contagious for at least 10 days after the first symptoms of the illness. This means that the virus is transmitted during this period to people who come in contact with the infected person. After 10 days, the infected person is no longer contagious. So, I advise you to wait for at least 10 days before getting tested. However, if your child or mother develops symptoms of the infection, you can get tested immediately. Hope this answers your question. Please feel free to ask for more information.
1. Don't be worried, don't panic. Panic won't help you. 2. Be positive and stay calm. 3. Do regular handwashing with soap. 4. Avoid touching your face. 5. Avoid contact with sick people. 6.

The current situation is not a time to be stressed. It is the time to remain calm. It is the time to remain in touch with your friends and family. It is the time to stay healthy by eating healthy and staying away from alcohol and smoking. It is the time to stay away from the news and social media as it is making the situation worse. You can take some anti-anxiety medications for the time being. But I would suggest you to go to a psychiatrist and get yourself evaluated.
I think you have to take some tests to see if there is any damage to your lungs. The first test I would recommend is a chest X-ray. The second test is a PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If the chest X-ray shows any damage to the lungs, you may need a CT scan of the chest. Also, the PFT will tell us what kind of lung damage you have. This will help us treat you properly.

I'm sorry to hear that you have diabetes. It is important to know that diabetes increases the risk of severe complications from the virus. This is because diabetes weakens your immune system and makes you more prone to infections. However, the severity of the complications depends on the type of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin, which is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. It is not clear whether type 1 diabetes increases the risk of severe complications from the virus. However, it is important to take extra precautions to protect yourself from the virus, such as practicing good hygiene, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and getting vaccinated. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Chronic pneumonia is caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi. If the causative agent is known, the best option is to treat the cause. In some cases, the cause is unknown.

In such cases, it is best to consult a pulmonologist for proper management.

Hello, Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and understand your concern. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, which means it is a disease where the body immune system attacks the insulin producing cells of pancreas and causes damage to them. This is the reason that patients with type 1 diabetes have to take insulin to maintain their blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes does not mean that a person has low immunity. It is an autoimmune disease, but the person with type 1 diabetes has normal immunity. However, it is known that persons with type 1 diabetes have a higher risk for certain infections. This is because of the following reasons. 1. The person is not able to maintain blood sugar levels in the normal range, so the immune system is not able to function properly. 2. The person is not able to maintain a normal diet due to the disease. Hope this was useful. Wish you good health.
Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor, I am very glad that you have contacted us. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. It is caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Treatment of pneumonia depends on the cause of infection. For example, if the infection is caused by bacteria, the patient is given antibiotics like amoxicillin and azithromycin. However, if the infection is caused by a virus, the patient is given medications that treat the symptoms like fever and cough. I hope that answers your question. If you have any further questions, please contact us again.
A persistent cough can be due to several reasons including pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), post nasal discharge, tuberculosis, lung cancer, and so on. However, persistent cough is not always due to pneumonia. It depends on the duration of cough and other symptoms. If you have a fever, breathlessness, chest pain, greenish sputum, then it is more likely to be pneumonia. If you have a history of smoking, then it can be due to COPD. If you have a history of allergy or asthma, then it can be due to asthma or bronchitis. You need to consult a pulmonologist for proper evaluation and management. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Best,
Covering mouth and nose is the only thing you can do to protect yourself from corona virus. Covering eyes with masks is not required. In fact, covering eyes with masks will not be comfortable. So it is not advised to cover eyes with mask. You can wear goggles if you want to protect eyes from corona virus.
Heart valve disease is a risk factor for death due to coronavirus, and you should be vigilant. If you start to feel symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, you should isolate yourself and seek immediate medical attention.

You should also make sure you're up to date on your vaccinations, including the flu vaccine, to reduce your risk of other infections. I hope this helps!
Thank you for your question. I have read your question carefully and understand your concerns. Your symptoms are not specific to the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, since you are in frequent close contact with tourists, I recommend that you get tested for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to rule out the infection. I hope my advice will help you. Take care.
Thank you for your question on Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. To confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19, you need to do a test to look for the virus in your nose or throat. The test is done by swabbing your nose or throat with a soft brush. This is called a nasal or throat swab test. If you have symptoms of a cold or flu, you may have a rapid test that looks for proteins in the virus. This test is done by putting a few drops of fluid from your nose or throat onto a test stick. It is also called a rapid antigen test. This test is not as accurate as the nasal or throat swab test. If you have a fever or cough, you should talk to your doctor to see if you need to be tested for COVID-19. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions, I will be happy to help.
Thank you for your query. It is important to keep in mind that most of the patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus do not develop any symptoms, or only have mild symptoms that may resemble the common cold. In addition, most of the patients who have severe symptoms from the virus are at risk of developing severe pneumonia, which is rare in healthy individuals. In addition, many of the symptoms that you are experiencing are commonly associated with a number of other respiratory infections such as the common cold, sinusitis, and the flu. The most important step in diagnosing whether you have the virus is to get tested for it. The gold standard for diagnosis is a PCR test. If you are not able to get a PCR test, then an antigen test will suffice. If you are not able to get either, then you can get an antibody test, which will tell you whether you have had the virus in the past. If you do not have the virus, then the next step is to consult a physician who will determine whether you have any other conditions that may be causing your symptoms. This will help you to be able to get the proper treatment.
Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. First, I would like to know if you have developed any symptoms. If you have developed symptoms, you should get tested. If you do not have any symptoms, you do not need to get tested immediately. You can get tested in the following 14 days. I hope you will find this helpful. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to write to us again. Best wishes,

There is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through food. However, it is important to be cautious and follow food safety practices, such as washing your hands before eating, and washing fruits and vegetables before eating them. In addition, it is important to cook food thoroughly and avoid eating undercooked or raw meat. It is also important to avoid eating food that is not fresh or has been left out at room temperature for a long time. These measures can help reduce the risk of infection from foodborne illnesses, but they do not necessarily prevent transmission of the virus through food. It is important to follow other preventive measures, such as washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and wearing a mask in public, to reduce the risk of infection.
Thank you for sharing your concern with us. It is very difficult to say without an examination. The symptoms you have described are non-specific and can occur in many viral infections. It can be a cold, flu, common cold or even a bacterial infection. If you have symptoms like fever, cough, headache and sore throat, you should go to the nearest clinic and get tested for the virus. It is also important to wear a mask and wash your hands often. Hope you feel better soon.
The development of a vaccine for humans is a different process. It is not possible to just take a vaccine for a pet and change a few things to use it on a human. This is because the human body is different from that of a pet. The immune system of a human is also different from that of a pet. The human immune system is more complex. Therefore, it is not possible to use the vaccine in pets for humans.
I understand your concerns but you have not mentioned whether you are a patient of tuberculosis and pneumonia or someone is asking about treatment for others. Please mention your gender and age. If you are a patient of both tuberculosis and pneumonia then you will have to take anti-tubercular treatment for 6 months and antibiotics for 7-10 days depending on the severity of pneumonia. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
1. You have not mentioned the type of pneumonia you are having. It can be of bacterial, viral, fungal, or even non-infectious origin.2. If it is bacterial in origin, and if the patient is taking proper treatment and is responding well, the improvement should be seen in about 5-7 days.3. However, if the patient is not responding well to the treatment, or if the patient has other co-morbid conditions, then the duration of treatment is longer.4. If it is viral in origin, the duration of treatment is longer than bacterial.5. If it is fungal in origin, the duration of treatment is even longer than bacterial.6. If it is non-infectious in origin, then the duration of treatment depends upon the cause of the non-infectious pneumonia.7. It is best to consult a pulmonologist for a detailed evaluation and management.
Thank you for your question. The virus is not known to survive long on surfaces. It is thought to be transmitted by aerosolized respiratory secretions. I would not worry about touching an object that might have virus on it. I would worry more about touching your face, or touching your face after touching someone.
1. As of now, your symptoms are not suggestive of any kind of infection.2. In case you are suspecting yourself of having any infection, you can go for a chest X-ray or a CT scan of the chest to rule out any infection.3.

In case you are having any fever or cough, you can take a course of antibiotics after consulting your doctor.5. Take care of your self, stay safe.
I would suggest that you go to the testing center in your area to take the test. If you are symptomatic, please get tested. If you are asymptomatic, please wear a mask and maintain social distancing. Hope that helps.
Thank you for asking in this forum. First of, you have done the right thing by quarantining yourself after finding out that you had been in contact with a confirmed case. Now, you will need to quarantine for 14 days from the day you had the exposure to that person. You are not showing any symptoms at the moment so you are fine. But you need to monitor your temperature and look out for any respiratory symptoms like cough, cold, chest tightness, breathlessness etc. If you develop any of these symptoms, you should immediately get yourself tested for the virus and seek medical attention. If you do not develop any symptoms after 14 days, you are safe and you can go back to your normal life. Hope this helps.

I would say that there is no direct link between shaving and the transmission of the virus. Shaving does not prevent or reduce the risk of getting the virus. It is important to follow the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization and other health authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. These include washing your hands frequently with soap and water, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Thank you for sharing your concern. Based on the symptoms you described, I would advise you to self-quarantine yourself for a few days and monitor your symptoms. You should not go out of your house and stay away from other people. If you feel that you are getting worse, please contact your local health department for further assistance.
Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor, thanks for your query. I am sorry to hear about your illness. Fever is usually a result of infection. It is a response of the body to infection. It is a good sign that the fever is subsiding and you are getting well. The antibiotics given to you were the best possible choice. You should continue to take them as prescribed. You should take a course of the antibiotic for the prescribed duration. I hope this helped you. Wishing you a speedy recovery. Regards
Thank you for sharing your concern. Cough is one of the symptoms of pneumonia. The treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of infection. A chest X-ray and sputum examination can be done to find out the cause of the infection. It can be a bacterial or a viral infection. Pneumonia can be treated with antibiotics like Azithromycin, Amoxicillin, etc. if it is caused by a bacterial infection. If it is caused by a viral infection, it can be treated with antiviral medications like Acyclovir, Oseltamivir, etc. If the patient is a smoker, he should stop smoking immediately. Hope this helps. Please feel free to ask for more clarification.
Thank you for posting your query to Chat Doctor. First I would like to congratulate you for quitting smoking. It is very difficult to quit smoking but it is very necessary to quit smoking. Inflamed sinuses and runny nose can be due to any viral infection including corona virus. But it is not necessary that it is due to corona virus. Inflamed sinuses and runny nose can be due to any viral infection. I would advise you to take steam inhalation. You can take decongestant nasal spray. I hope you would find this answer useful. Please feel free to adt me for further questions.
Pneumonia is a condition in which the lungs get infected by bacteria or virus. It is not a disease but a condition. There are many causes of pneumonia. The treatment depends upon the cause of pneumonia. The main symptoms of pneumonia are fever, cough, breathing difficulty and chest pain. The treatment of pneumonia is antibiotics, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory medications. You can take paracetamol for fever. Paracetamol can be taken for fever. The dose is 500 mg per dose. Frisium is a medicine which is used for the treatment of epilepsy. It is a sedative. It is not useful in pneumonia. The dose of frisium is 5-10 mg per day. Mucolite is a mucolytic medicine. It is useful in the treatment of pneumonia. Mucolite helps in the removal of phlegm from the lungs. You can take mucolite in the treatment of pneumonia. The dose of mucolite is 10 ml per dose.
If you are suspecting of having a respiratory tract infection, then you can get yourself tested for the following things. First, a complete blood count to check for any raised white blood cells, which will suggest infection. Then a chest X-ray to check for any signs of pneumonia. Next, a rapid antigen test for the detection of the virus. However, the rapid antigen test will be positive only in the first few days of infection. If it is negative, then you can get a PCR test done, which is more sensitive and accurate. However, you should get this test done within 10 days of your symptoms.
There is no evidence to suggest that ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs will worsen a person's chances of contracting or getting severe illness from the coronavirus. However, some people may want to avoid taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen as they may increase the risk of kidney damage, especially in people who already have kidney damage or are on dialysis. For mild symptoms like a headache or a mild fever, acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a good choice. If you have kidney damage, please consult your doctor before taking any NSAIDs.
Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. I am sorry to hear that you have cold. As you have diarrhea, I would like to tell you that diarrhea is not a symptom of corona virus infection. It is a symptom of some other infection. So, I would like to tell you that you should not worry about corona virus infection. You can take some anti-diarrheal medication. You can also take some cough and cold medication. You should also do some home remedies like steam inhalation and warm saline gargles. Take care.
Thank you for your question. I will try to explain it to you. The temperature at which the virus is destroyed is about 70 degrees Celsius. This temperature is used to sterilize the medical instruments in the hospital. You can use this temperature to destroy the virus. But it is not necessary to use it. You can use gloves and masks to protect yourself from the virus. Regarding your second question, the full form of the name is Coronavirus disease. I hope this helps you. Please feel free to contact me for further questions.
Thank you for choosing our service. I have gone through your case history. Coughing and chest heaviness can be due to bronchitis or pneumonia.

You may require antibiotics, bronchodilators and other medicines. Please get back to us with the reports of chest x-ray. I hope it will be helpful to you. If you have any further queries please feel free to ask. Regards
Hi, Yes, symptoms of coronavirus can be mild or severe in some people. The common symptoms of coronavirus are fever, cough, breathing difficulty, fatigue, loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, muscle or body aches. But not all patients have the same symptoms. Some people experience mild symptoms and some people experience severe symptoms. Some people may not even have any symptoms at all. Some people may have symptoms similar to common cold. So, I would suggest you to take precautions like wear a mask, wash your hands with hand sanitizer frequently, avoid touching your face and maintain social distancing. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
You are having fever and headache with body aching and sneezing. It is suggestive of viral infection. In such case, paracetamol is the best medicine to control fever.

I can understand your concern, but there are a number of variations in the symptoms of the disease. Some people may have all the symptoms, while others may have only one or two. There are many people who have only a fever, cough, or cold. However, most people are asymptomatic. I would advise you to get your self checked if you are feeling any symptoms.

If you're a smoker, you should quit. This will help your body fight off the infection and prevent further damage to your lungs. You can also get a pneumonia vaccine. There are two types of pneumonia vaccines, and they're recommended for adults 65 and older, or adults 19 to 64 with chronic lung disease, heart disease, diabetes, or liver disease. A chest X-ray should be done to see the extent of the infection. If you have a high fever, cough with greenish mucus, and trouble breathing, you may need antibiotics.  The most common antibiotics used to treat pneumonia are penicillin or amoxicillin. However, you may need a different antibiotic if you're allergic to penicillin.  You can also use cough suppressants like dextromethorphan or codeine to help you sleep at night.  You can also use acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve the fever and body aches.
Please check your temperature regularly and if it is more than 38 degrees Celsius, please get tested. If you do not have the symptoms, there is no need to get tested. You may have a common cold. Take paracetamol and decongestant medication. You may get tested for dengue, malaria, and other viral infections if you have severe symptoms.
I would like to know the severity of your COPD. Also, what is your lung function. If it is a mild to moderate COPD then you can take oral antibiotics to treat the pneumonia. If the infection is severe then you need to be hospitalized and intravenous antibiotics will be needed. You can also take nebulization with bronchodilators. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.
The most common causes of pneumonia are the bacteria (like streptococcus pneumoniae), viruses, and fungi. The risk of developing pneumonia is higher in patients with weak immune system, or in patients with chronic lung disease or other chronic disease, or in patients who are on chronic steroids or other immunosuppressants. In patients with chronic lung disease, the most common cause of pneumonia is the bacteria, whereas in patients with normal lungs, viruses are the most common cause. Hope this helps.
Please see your doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. Your doctor will prescribe you antibiotics and other medicines depending upon the severity of pneumonia. Please do not self-medicate yourself. You should also be in good rest and follow a healthy diet. I hope it helps.
Right central pneumonia refers to pneumonia that affects the central part of the right lung. It is a type of pneumonia that is caused by bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms.

The treatment for right central pneumonia depends on the severity of the infection and the type of microorganism that is causing it. If the infection is mild, it can be treated with antibiotics. If it is severe, it may require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics to prevent the infection from recurring. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Hello, thanks for using Chat Doctor. Pneumonia can be caused by CPAP machines, but this is uncommon. The most common cause is bacteria, but pneumonia can also be caused by fungi, viruses, and parasites. It is possible that bacteria or other organisms can be present in the CPAP machine, and if the patient has a weak immune system, the bacteria can cause pneumonia. This can be prevented by cleaning the CPAP machine regularly. Hope this helps, please feel free to ask if you have any further questions.
You need to get tested. If you have had a recent travel history, you need to get a chest X-ray and a CBC (Complete Blood Count) to check for any infection. If your symptoms persist, you need to get a CT scan of the sinuses to check for any sinusitis or nasal polyps. I would also recommend a nasal endoscopy to check for any obstruction. Please do not delay. You may need to see an ENT specialist for this.
